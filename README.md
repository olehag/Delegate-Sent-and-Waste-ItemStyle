# Delegate Sent and Waste ItemStyle


Adds the registery keys;
DelegateWastebasketStyle -value 4
&
DelegateSentItemsStyle -value 1

These RegKeys make Outlook sync read and deleted emails between clients, who use the same email.
example: to use with a shared mail for inquiries to a company.

This way if one operator reads and answers an email, the other operator can see this. so both dont answer the same inquiry.
